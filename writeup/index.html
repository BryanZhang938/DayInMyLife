    <h1>A Day In My Life</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Writeup</h2>
        <p>The webpage has 2 main pages where the first site displays some stats for a participant's sleep within the dataset and other summary stats. At the bottom, there's a scatter plot with information about their BMI, age, and average heart rate(representing size). Clicking on these dots that represent each user will take them to a page that has 2 line graphs displaying activity and heart rate throughout the day and can be controlled by an auto scroller or by manually scrolling the page. These line graphs also have a tooltip that displays more specific information depending on where the cursor is hovering. What we plan to do to move the sleep data and summary stats on the bottom of the scroller. This would be kind of a summary for the day. We also added the animations that moves with the scroller, but it is still not on its final form.

            The most challenging part of the project is being able to implement the interactive parts of the page, such as the scrollable line graphs. Planning the design of the page has also been very challenging because there are many separate parts and planning ahead to be able to accommodate for all of these different parts is not a simple task. Adding in animations to represent the activities that a participant is doing is very difficult too because creating animations is difficult and writing the code to implement these animations takes time to learn and use effectively. Another aspect that seems very challenging is to ensure that the data displayed on the page is accustomed to the participant that the website user selects.
